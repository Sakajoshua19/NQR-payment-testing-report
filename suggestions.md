# Recommendations for Improvement

1. ✅ *Prevent Duplicate Transactions*
   - Implement backend checks to reject or flag reused QR codes
   - Consider rate-limiting QR scans per session

2. 🔄 *Session Timeout Redirect*
   - Add timeout listener that redirects users back to PayXpress with proper feedback
   - Improves session clarity and user experience

3. 🖼 *Improve UI Feedback*
   - Add loading spinners, status indicators (e.g., "Processing...", "Success", "Failed")
   - Display errors with human-readable messages

4. 🏦 *Handle Unsupported Banks Gracefully*
   - Show a message like: "This bank is not currently supported for NQR payments"
   - Improve UX by not hanging indefinitely

5. 📬 *Transaction Reconciliation Confirmation*

   - Log transaction IDs and reconciliation status for auditing
